NEED OF PYTHON :
1)Applications :all types Applications can be developed by using python for example
web application software developement gui games 3d applications   
2)Multiple PROGRAMMING paradigm :continous  supports  to serval  paradigms like structured PROGRAMMING ,oop PROGRAMMING
and also functional PROGRAMMING 
3)Robust standard library:it has a large standard library which has many pakages  that supports in code reusablity and 
we can use python over other languages also and here we have modules by that we will not be needed to write codes again and again 
4)compatible with major platform and system :as it supports many operating systems with the help of python interpreaters the specific code can be run 
5)database:python helps in accessing database easily as it supports all the databases for example:mysql ,oracle etc ...
6)code readablity:python is a language which has easiest syntex here even we can read the code very easily 
7)simplifies hard software development:it helps in simplifiction of hard software codes which saves time
8)many open frameworks and tools :python is alnaguage which has many frameworks and tools to worked on which are free to use and its liabraries and 
frameworks are free to use 
9)adopt test driven development : python is a LANUAGE which is easily understandable and readable as well as it have easy testing and it has raised a 
test driven development approach which makes checking and testing of softwares easiest
10)other Applications for which python is used :it also supports many other applications like robotics, ai, color dection and face detection data science etc..
